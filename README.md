#### With the introduction of countless frontend concepts during my first internship, I aim to practice and broaden my understanding on them. Such concepts and technologies include, but are not limited to:
- ReactJS (Functional Components & Basic Hooks)
- TypeScript in General
- Tailwind CSS & daisyUI (Animations & Responsiveness)
- Data Structures & Pathfinding Algorithms (Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, etc.)
